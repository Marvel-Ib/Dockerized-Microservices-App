# Dockerized-Microservices-App
A very simple application to showcase my knowledge of microservices architecture and docker.

Note: The app does not really have a usecase I was more focused on the architecural pattern and also the implementation
I will definitely still create a side-project that will have a usecase and beautiful architectural pattern

### Highlights:
- I made my own API GATEWAY ( a shared layer to serve client requirements with microservices architecture).
- I used a docker compose file to ensure communication between my services(Gave me a tough time. Had a major error you can read about it in my Error Highlight).
- I used Babel so I could write next-gen Javascript thereby making my code more readable.


### Technologies

Node.js --- Docker----MySQL---ExpressJs---Babel---PayStack-Api 

## Project Implementation 

**File Structure Picture**
